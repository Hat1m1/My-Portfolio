        <p class="introduction">
            Hi! My name is <span>Hatim.</span><br> 
            <br>Nearly 4 years ago, I moved to the United Kingdom from Spain, not knowing that this decision would impact
             my entire life for many reasons. The first challenge was not having any friends, and I could not speak a word 
             of English. I also had to navigate a completely new education system that I had never been introduced to before.
             On top of that, I had only one year to prepare for my GCSEs, which at the time, I did not even know existed.
             The most difficult part about this was that I had no one to support me through this journey.<br>
            
           <br> I believe that most people in my position would have simply given up, as there were many obstacles to overcome. 
           However, not me, I never considered giving up as an option. To improve my English, I used movies, videos, and books. 
           I even went outside to parks to talk with people, regardless of their age, just to practice speaking.<br> 
           
           <br> Believe it or not, after overcoming the initial challenges of making friends, learning English, and 
           familiarising myself with life in the UK, I had only 38 days left to revise for my GCSEs! Again, giving up 
           was never an option, so I spent 5 hours studying after every school day and 8 hours on weekends. After all 
           these efforts, I managed to achieve amazing results, averaging a grade 7 across all 9 GCSE subjects I chose.<br>

            My Sixth Form Years
        </h2>

        <p class="second-paragraph">
            I have created amazing memories, friends and expiriences in my time at Aston University Sixth Form.
            I chose to study A-level Spanish and BTEC Engineering extended diploma, as I enjoy engineering, additionally
            it would help me get into the field I disire the most which is &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
            &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
            . Most importantly, the course offered many opportunites for international internships which was amazing as it 
            would help me get into my field by getting real life expirience with a real employer.<br>

            <br>

            <br>I meet amazing like-minded individuals which wanted to get in the same field as me, we explored the streets
            of Birmingham together and tried every caffee and restaurant in city center in our breaks, we enjoyed each others
            precense and everybody was welcomed in our group.
        </p>
